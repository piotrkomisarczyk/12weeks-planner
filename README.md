## Project Description

**12 Weeks Planner** is a web-based goal planning and tracking tool inspired by Brian P. Moran's "The 12 Week Year" and Brian Tracy's "Eat That Frog". The application provides users with a structured approach to achieving their long-term goals through focused 12-week planning cycles.

### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Goal Management**: Organize your work with a three-tier hierarchy (goals → weekly tasks → daily tasks)
- **Task Prioritization**: Categorize tasks using A/B/C priority levels to focus on what matters most
- **Advanced Task States**: Track progress with multiple states (to-do, in progress, completed, cancelled, postponed)
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Monitor goal achievement with visual progress bars
- **Weekly Reflections**: Build self-awareness through structured weekly summary questions
- **Multiple Views**: Navigate between dashboard, goals, weekly planning, daily tasks, and summaries
- **Privacy-Focused**: Personal planners with secure authentication - your data stays yours
- **Bilingual Support**: Available in English and Polish

### Target Users

Individual users seeking an advanced, structured approach to goal planning beyond simple to-do lists.

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** version `22.14.0` (as specified in `.nvmrc`)
  - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions:
    ```bash
    nvm use
    ```

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/12weeks-planner.git
   cd 12weeks-planner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```env
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
   
   You can find these values in your Supabase project settings under API.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4321` (or the port shown in your terminal)

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Astro development server with hot module replacement |
| `npm run build` | Creates an optimized production build |
| `npm run preview` | Previews the production build locally |
| `npm run astro` | Runs Astro CLI commands |
| `npm run lint` | Checks code for linting errors |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Automatically fixes linting errors where possible |
| `npm run format` | Formats code using Prettier |

### Development Workflow

For the best development experience:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run linter in watch mode (optional)
npm run lint

# Before committing, format and fix issues
npm run lint:fix
npm run format
```

Git hooks via Husky will automatically run linting on staged files before commit.
